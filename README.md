This is my coursework for Coursera's Object-Oriented Programming in Java class from UC San Diego. Use at your own risk. I'm considering it public domain.

The course uses Eclipse for teaching the class.  While at one point I was adept at using both vi and Emacs, I'm not doing that in the GUI IDE world.  I use IntelliJ at work, and this repo uses IntelliJ.  If you use Eclipse, you need to follow the UCSD setup instructions.

When trying to run with PApplet in IntelliJ, you need to specify the complete path to the class being executed in the Run Configuration.  IntelliJ will default the program arguments to just the class name, you need to add the full package name to it.  For instance, use HelloUCSDWorld as the program argument (because it isn't in a package) to execute HelloUCSDWorld, or module4.EarthquakeCityMap to execute EarthquakeCityMap for Module 4.
