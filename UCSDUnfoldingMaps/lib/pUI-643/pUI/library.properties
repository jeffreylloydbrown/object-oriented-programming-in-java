# The category of your library, must be one (or many) of the following:
#   "3D"            "Animation"     "Compilations"      "Data"

# If a value other than those listed is used, your library will listed as

category = GUI

# A short sentence (or fragment) to summarize the library's function. This will 
# be shown from inside the PDE when the library is being installed. Avoid 
# repeating the name of your library here. Also, avoid saying anything redundant 
# like mentioning that it's a library. This should start with a capitalized 
# letter, and end with a period.
sentence = A Graphical User Interface Library for Processing 2.0

# Additional information suitable for the Processing website. The value of
# 'sentence' always will be prepended, so you should start by writing the
# second sentence here. If your library only works on certain operating systems,
# mention it here.
paragraph = This project attempts to learn from and build on the existing GUI libraries while keeping in mind the design principles that lie at the heart of Processing: Minimalism, accessibility and extensibility. Ultimately the aim is to spark discussion on what a core GUI library for Processing might encompass. 

# Links in the 'sentence' and 'paragraph' attributes can be inserted using the
# same syntax as for authors. 
# That is, [here is a link to Processing](http://processing.org/)


# A version number that increments once with each release. This is used to 
# compare different versions of the same library, and check if an update is 
# available. You should think of it as a counter, counting the total number of 
# releases you've had.
version = 643  # This must be parsable as an int

# The version as the user will see it. If blank, the version attribute will be 
# used here.
prettyVersion = 0.3  # This is treated as a String
